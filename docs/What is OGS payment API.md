Our mode of payment is closest to that of the Ghanaian but also include all the modes of local African payments, the user makes a request according to the desired product he is redirected to a page that asks for information and select his purchase option if the request is validated he gets a code that he records in the game and the purchase is validated. This mode is simple and can be used by all those who have an account on OPEN its limitation is that it is currently available only in CÃ´te d'Ivoire for mobile money like (Orange, Mtn, Moov), but for the payment mode as "Wave" it is available in countries like (Burkina, Mali, and Senegal). It is also being tested in our different games, regarding the addition of the module for game developers we integrate it and provide you with custom documentation according to your game engine.
